/**
 * Level2 ex 17. When you say you are 18 years old, you are really saying that the Earth has
 * circled the Sun 18 times. Since other planets take fewer or more days than
 * Earth to travel around the Sun, your age would be different on other planets.
 * You can compute how old you are on other planets by the formula
 * y =(x*365)/d
 * where x is the age on Earth, y is the age on planet Y, and d is the number of
 * Earth days the planet Y takes to travel around the Sun. Write an application
 * that inputs the userâ€™s Earth age and print outs his or her age on Mercury,
 * Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn. The values for d are listed in the table.
 * d  Approximate Number of Earth
 * Days for This Planet to Travel
 * Planet around the Sun
 * Mercury 88
 * Venus 225
 * Jupiter 4,380
 * Saturn 10,767
