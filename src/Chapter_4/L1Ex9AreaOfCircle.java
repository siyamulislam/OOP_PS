/**
 * Level ex 9. Write a program that computes the area of a circular region (the shaded area
 * in the diagram), given the radii of the inner and the outer circles, ri and ro,
 * respectively
 * *
 * We compute the area of the circular region by subtracting the area of the
 * inner circle from the area of the outer circle. Define a Circle class that has
 * methods to compute the area and circumference. You set the circleâ€™s radius
 * with the setRadius method or via a constructor
